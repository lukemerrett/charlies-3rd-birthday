# Charlie's 3rd Birthday Surprise

A GitHub Pages site to reveal a Thomas Land trip voucher to Charlie on his 3rd birthday.

## What it does

The page opens with a "Happy Birthday Charlie!" message and a big "Tap for your surprise!" button. When tapped, it triggers a celebration sequence:

- **Voucher reveal** - the Thomas Land voucher zooms in with a spring animation, framed in a glowing gold border
- **Confetti** - bursts from the centre and rains down from the top in multiple waves
- **Balloons** - float up from the bottom of the screen
- **Sparkle stars** - spin around the voucher
- **Trains** - two trains chug across the bottom of the screen on a track, looping forever with steam puffs
- **Music** - plays the Thomas the Tank Engine theme tune on reveal

## Background

The page has a sky-blue gradient with CSS clouds drifting across.
